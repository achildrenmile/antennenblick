    "dipole": {
      "low": "Low dipole = high angle radiation. Ideal for NVIS (local contacts up to 500 km). Signal goes nearly straight up and comes back down in the vicinity.",
      "medium": "Medium height = balanced pattern. Compromise between local and DX. Good for nets and general operation.",
      "high": "High dipole = low angle radiation. Better for DX, but skip zone nearby. Higher is better for long-distance contacts."
    },
    "vertical": {
      "low": "Verticals radiate at low angles by nature - ideal for DX. But: ground quality is crucial! Without good radials or moist ground, you lose a lot of energy.",
      "medium": "Radials matter more than height! 16+ radials of 1/4λ dramatically improve efficiency. Saltwater or wet meadow are natural 'radials'.",
      "high": "More height doesn't help verticals much - the feedpoint should be near ground. Invest in radials rather than a taller mast."
    },
    "vertical58": {
      "low": "The 5/8λ vertical has ~2 dB more gain than 1/4λ due to lower radiation angle. But requires matching network (coil or stub).",
      "medium": "Typical VHF/UHF antenna: 5/8λ above ground or counterpoise. The gain comes from concentrating radiation in the horizontal plane.",
      "high": "Unlike the 1/4λ vertical, the 5/8λ always needs a matching network - the impedance is not directly 50 ohms."
    },
    "collinear": {
      "low": "The Collinear stacks multiple radiators vertically for even lower radiation angle and more gain (5-6 dBi).",
      "medium": "Typical technology for VHF/UHF repeater stations. Consists of multiple 5/8λ elements with phasing sections.",
      "high": "The more elements, the higher the gain, but also more complex construction. Typically 2-4 elements for amateur use."
    },
    "invertedV": {
      "low": "The Inverted-V is a great compromise: needs only one mast in the middle and radiates somewhat more omnidirectionally than a flat dipole.",
      "medium": "Watch the included angle: 90-120° between legs is ideal. Too flat = too much high-angle radiation, too steep = mechanically unstable.",
      "high": "When mounted higher, the pattern approaches that of a horizontal dipole. Still retains the advantage of simple construction."
    },
    "efhw": {
      "low": "The EFHW (End-Fed Half-Wave) behaves similar to a dipole but needs only one support point. Great for portable setups.",
      "medium": "Advantage: Multi-band capable with matching unun (49:1). Disadvantage: More sensitive to RF in the shack, good grounding important.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the EFHW becomes a serious DX antenna. The wire can run at an angle - flexibility is the main advantage."
    },
    "randomWire": {
      "low": "A random wire is the 'emergency antenna' - any wire, hung up somehow. Works surprisingly often, but the pattern is unpredictable.",
      "medium": "With an antenna tuner, almost anything works. Efficiency varies greatly depending on length and mounting. Experimentation is key!",
      "high": "Length matters more than shape. 20-40m of wire, as high and clear as possible, gives surprising results even without optimization."
    },
    "deltaLoop": {
      "low": "The Delta Loop has ~1 dB gain over a dipole and radiates at relatively low angles when mounted horizontally - good for DX.",
      "medium": "Triangle shape: one corner at the mast top, two at the bottom. Needs less height than a dipole for comparable DX performance.",
      "high": "At full wavelength circumference (e.g., 40m on 40m band), the loop shows its full potential. Also good for receiving."
    },
    "g5rv": {
      "low": "The G5RV is a multiband compromise: a 31m dipole with 10m ladder line as matching. Works on 80-10m with a tuner.",
      "medium": "No optimal SWR on any band, but 'good enough' everywhere. The ladder line should run as vertically as possible.",
      "high": "Classic for hams with limited space. Not the best antenna for any single band, but the most practical for all of them."
    },
    "yagi2el": {
      "low": "A 2-element Yagi focuses the signal in one direction (~5 dBd gain). Less power needed, but you must know where to point it!",
      "medium": "Yagis need height and clear view. A rotator makes them truly useful. For a fixed direction (e.g., USA) also useful without rotator.",
      "high": "On 20m or higher, the Yagi becomes manageable. On 40m it's a project, on 80m you need a farm."
    },
    "yagi3el": {
      "low": "3 elements = more gain (~8 dBd), narrower beam, better front-to-back ratio. The serious DX antenna.",

      "high": "High on a mast, a 3-element Yagi is a DX machine. Combined with a good location = pile-up killer."
    },
    "yagi4el": {
      "low": "4 elements bring ~9 dBd gain. The boom gets longer, but front-to-back ratio improves further.",
      "medium": "From 4 elements, wind load becomes a real issue. On 20m already ~8m boom length! Mechanics are as important as electronics.",
      "high": "Mounted high, an excellent DX antenna. The narrower beam means: aim more precisely, but more signal at the target."
    },
    "yagi5el": {
      "low": "5 elements = ~10 dBd gain. Already a 'large' antenna, typical for contest stations and DXers.",
      "medium": "Boom gets very long (10m+ on 20m). Needs a sturdy rotator and strong mast. F/B ratio is excellent.",
      "high": "A 5-element Yagi high on a mast is a pile-up breaking weapon. Serious equipment for serious DX hunters."
    },
    "yagi6el": {
      "low": "6 elements bring ~11 dBd - that's 12× the power of a dipole in one direction! But: size and complexity increase.",
      "medium": "Typical for 10m/15m bands where the antenna is still manageable. On 20m you need a farm and a crane.",
      "high": "A 6-element Yagi is contest and DXpedition equipment. Combined with low-band verticals the ultimate setup."
    },
    "magloop": {
      "low": "The Magnetic Loop is small, efficient, and radiates at high angles - ideal for NVIS and space-limited situations (balcony, attic).",
      "medium": "Very narrowband! Retune after every QSY. But: low-noise reception and no radials needed.",
      "high": "Can be used indoors, but outdoors is better. Tuning is critical - motorized tuning highly recommended."
    },
    "windom": {
      "low": "The Windom (OCF Dipole) is fed off-center. This allows multiband operation without a tuner. Lower = more high-angle radiation.",
      "medium": "Feed point is at ~1/3 of total length. Matches 50 ohms with 4:1 or 6:1 balun. Good multiband compromise.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the Windom behaves like a good DX dipole. The asymmetry adds slight directivity - can be advantage or disadvantage."
    },
    "zepp": {
      "low": "The Zepp antenna is end-fed via ladder line. Low mounting for regional contacts, but it's naturally more of a DX antenna.",
      "medium": "Advantage: Very efficient as no current needs to flow at the feed point. Works well on harmonics of the fundamental frequency.",
      "high": "The classic Zepp was the antenna of the Zeppelins. Today popular as multiband DX antenna with low-angle radiation."
    },
    "edz": {
      "low": "The Extended Double Zepp (EDZ) is 1.28λ long - yielding ~4 dBd gain bidirectionally. Needs more space than a dipole.",
      "medium": "The EDZ radiates in two directions with high gain. Ideal when you have two preferred directions (e.g., USA and Japan).",
      "high": "Mounted high, the EDZ is one of the best wire antennas for DX. Ladder line feed makes it usable on multiple bands."
    },
    "quadLoop": {
      "low": "The Quad Loop has ~1-2 dB gain over a dipole and better noise rejection. Square or diamond-shaped loop.",
      "medium": "Polarization depends on feed point: horizontal when fed on side, vertical when fed at corner. Circumference = 1 wavelength.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the Quad is an excellent DX antenna. Less sensitive to environment than a dipole."
    },
    "quad2el": {
      "low": "The 2-element Quad has ~6-7 dBi gain - about 1 dB more than a 2-element Yagi with larger area but lighter construction.",
      "medium": "Quad loops can be built from thin wire (fiberglass spreaders). Lighter than aluminum Yagis with comparable performance.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the 2-el Quad is a real DX performer. Better signal-to-noise ratio than comparable Yagis."
    },
    "quad3el": {
      "low": "3 elements bring the Quad to ~8-9 dBi. The front-to-back ratio is typically better than a 3-el Yagi.",
      "medium": "Construction with spreaders makes the 3-el Quad more compact than you'd think. Popular DXpedition antenna.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the 3-element Quad is a serious DX machine with excellent front-to-back ratio and quiet reception."
    },
    "sloper": {
      "low": "The Sloper is a half-wave wire strung at an angle. It radiates toward the slope direction - simple directional antenna with just one mast.",
      "medium": "Upper end should be at a tall mast, lower end near ground. Typical angle: 30-45° to horizontal.",
      "high": "A high Sloper can work surprisingly well for DX in one direction. Multiple Slopers on same mast = switchable directions."
    },
    "longwire": {
      "low": "A true long wire is longer than 1 wavelength. This creates multiple radiation lobes - unpredictable but often practical.",
      "medium": "The longer the wire, the lower the main lobe and more side lobes appear. Good ground or counterpoise important.",
      "high": "The long wire was the classic DX antenna of the pioneer era. Now mostly replaced by beams, but still effective when space allows."
    },
    "cobweb": {
      "low": "The Cobweb/Spiderweb is a compact multiband antenna. Omnidirectional and lightweight - ideal for restricted rooftops.",
      "medium": "Works typically on 5 bands (20-10m) with only 3-4m diameter. No rotator needed, but also no gain.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the Cobweb is a good compromise between size and performance. Not as good as Yagi, but much more inconspicuous."
    },
    "hexbeam": {
      "low": "The Hexbeam is a compact directional antenna that works like a 2-element Yagi. Needs less space than classic beams.",
      "medium": "Typically 5-band capable with ~4m span. Lighter than a Yagi but similar directivity. Rotator recommended.",
      "high": "Mounted high, the Hexbeam is a serious DX contender. About 4-5 dBd gain, good front-to-back ratio."
    },
    "zs6bkw": {
      "low": "The ZS6BKW is an optimized G5RV variant with better SWR on multiple bands. 28m dipole with 13.4m ladder line.",
      "medium": "Works well on 40, 20, 17, 12, and 10m. On 80m and 15m with tuner. Less compromise than original G5RV.",

    },
    "hb9cv": {
      "low": "The HB9CV is a compact 2-element directional antenna with phased feed. Designed by Rudolf Baumgartner (HB9CV). Less space than Yagi.",

    "whatIsShortwave": "What is Shortwave?",
    "whatIsShortwaveText": "Shortwave (SW) are radio waves between 3 and 30 MHz. The special thing: They can be reflected by the ionosphere and 'skip' around the Earth. That's why you can communicate worldwide with little power - without internet or satellites.",
    "whatIsIonosphere": "What is the Ionosphere?",
    "whatIsIonosphereText": "The ionosphere is a layer at 80-400 km altitude where solar radiation 'charges' (ionizes) the air. This charged layer acts like a mirror for shortwave. During the day it's denser (higher frequencies are reflected), at night thinner (lower frequencies pass through).",
    "whatIsRadiationPattern": "What is a Radiation Pattern?",
    "whatIsRadiationPatternText": "A radiation pattern shows where your antenna sends its energy. Imagine a lamp: A flashlight radiates focused (like a Yagi), a light bulb in all directions (like a vertical). The diagram shows this 'shape' from above and from the side.",
    "whatIsWavelength": "What does Wavelength (λ) mean?",
    "whatIsWavelengthText": "Wavelength is the length of a radio wave. On 20m it's 20 meters, on 40m it's 40 meters. Important: Antenna height and length are often given in wavelengths. A dipole at '0.5λ height' is 10m high on 20m, but 20m high on 40m!",
    "whyAngle": "Why does the takeoff angle matter?",
    "whyAngleText": "The ionosphere reflects shortwave back to Earth. Depending on the angle, the signal lands closer (steep angle) or farther away (low angle). For local contacts you need high-angle radiation, for DX low-angle.",
    "whyHeight": "Why does height matter?",
    "whyHeightText": "Antenna height (measured in wavelengths) determines the takeoff angle. At λ/4 height, a dipole radiates steeply (NVIS), at λ/2 balanced, at 3/4 λ or more it radiates low (DX).",
    "whyGround": "Why does ground matter?",
    "whyGroundText": "The ground acts as a reflector. Good ground (moist, salty) reflects better. For vertical antennas, radials create an artificial 'good ground'. Poor ground 'absorbs' energy.",
    "whatIsNVIS": "What is NVIS?",
    "whatIsNVISText": "NVIS (Near Vertical Incidence Skywave) uses nearly vertical radiation. The signal goes up and comes back down within ~500 km - no skip zone. Perfect for emergency communications and regional nets. Only works on lower bands (160m-40m) with low-mounted antennas.",
    "whatIsDX": "What is DX?",
    "whatIsDXText": "DX means 'Distance' - long-distance contacts. The lower the takeoff angle, the farther the signal hops. With multiple reflections (multi-hop), worldwide contacts are possible. You need high-mounted antennas or verticals for this.",
    "whatIsSkipZone": "What is the Skip Zone?",
    "whatIsSkipZoneText": "Ground wave only reaches a few km. The skywave signal lands only beyond a certain distance. In between is the 'skip zone' - no reception possible. High-angle radiation reduces the skip zone.",
    "diagramExplain": "Understanding the Diagrams",
    "azimuthExplain": "The left diagram (azimuth pattern) shows the top view - as if you were looking down at your antenna. The red arrow shows orientation. The blue shape shows in which compass directions the signal is stronger or weaker.",
    "elevationExplain": "The right diagram (elevation pattern) shows the side view. The horizontal line is the ground. The blue shape shows how steeply the signal goes up. Close to ground = low-angle radiation (good for DX), close to vertical = high-angle radiation (good for NVIS)."

    "q9Opt1": "5-15 degrees",
    "q9Opt2": "30-45 degrees",
